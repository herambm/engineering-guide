        	It can be referred to as the mother of all branches in engineering. Involves a lot of technical drawing and must be opted only if you are sure that you don’t mind spending majority of your time in drawing and other related calculations. Complicated physics comprises a major part of the curriculum. Basics of automobiles are also included as a part of this course.<br><br>Job Prospects:

A lot of core mechanical companies, including Larsen and Toubro, Godrej offer highly technical job profiles. Students are expected to have a good knowledge of what they’ve studied in the past 4 years.<br><br>Best when done from:

        <div class="panel-body">One of the core engineering streams, it is related with study of infrastructure and construction of bridges, roads, dams, canals and buildings as well as their maintenance. If your dad’s a builder and you still want to study a bit (which isn’t a bad idea- studying a bit more won’t hurt you), then this is probably one good option for you.<br><br>
        Job Prospects:

Civil engineers plan and design bridges and tunnels, as well as highways, airfields, harbours, water and sewage systems, and buildings. They also supervise the construction of such projects to ensure that they are built according to carefully drafted plans. Thus they can expect to get jobs in companies that specialize in these functions, like L&T, etc.<br><br>

One of the in-demand courses.<br><br>
        Job Prospects:

Great job prospects. Most students get placed, regardless of college. A computer engineer continues doing what he’s been doing for years, i.e.- coding! Expect IT companies like Accenture, TCS, Infosys and Wipro to visit your college.<br><br>Best when done from:

Chemical based companies like aromatics, petrochemical, washing powder etc. However, most chemical engineers go abroad to do their Masters, after which they are often hired by pharmaceutical companies, or packaged-foods companies. Students doing their Masters in fields like perfumes can hope to get placed in some of the household perfume giants.<br><br>Best when done from:

Jobs offered are Core electrical, although very different from what your local electrician does.

You will be taught the basics of microprocessors, microcontrollers, their circuits, and working of the insides of a very basic level computer. You will also be given an introduction to robotics.<br><br>Job Prospects:

Core companies like Philips offer technical job profiles to candidates.

        <div class="panel-body">More to do with electronics than communication. So if you love telecommunication and are opting for this course only on the basis of that, bear in mind that only the last year of this curriculum truly deals with communication. In the first three years, you’ll be given an introduction to telecommunication but you will still be dealing with electronic circuits on a large scale, whether practically or on paper. Only the final year differs from electronics engineering, otherwise the curriculum is more or less the same. The subject content is the same, only the names of the subjects are changed to make it appear different.<br><br>Job Prospects:

A major difference between EXTC and Electronics may be the fact that, after doing a Masters and specializing in a particular field, a Telecom engineer can expect to work for Telecom giants like Reliance Communications, Huawei & Intervo or cellphone companies like Nokia, designing mobile networks or mobile phones respectively.
